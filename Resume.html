Effective educational planning enables them to make a smooth transition from school to college, further into technical education. A good educational plan will provide the student and his/her family with a map of future education and career growth. Through this poster, we help them in choosing The Right School/College by considering the economic position of the family. That is a question that parents and students answer within their planning for school, college, and technical education. With accelerated programs starting in school now, career & educational planning can begin as early as the school stage. Parents,administrators, and teachers can help middle school students take advanced courses with educational goals in mind. Carefully planning middle and high school coursework can help prepare you for college. Many students miss important educational opportunities because
                    they delay in making important educational decisions Feature scope: Digital transformation towards complete automation with the help of a smart card/UID which is connected to the cloud for the entire process of their academics and entire job description. This helps to maintain the documentation of the student database of school/college and to helps the corporate industries to hire the candidates in the feature and keep track of all the history of the candidate
